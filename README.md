# Pawno (Version 1.1)
Simple and lightweight Pawn script editor, for replacing the old official version of Pawno

#### Differences between this and original Pawno
- It's open source
- It has a 'Redo' button
- More Pawn language like highlighting instead of C++
- It associate `*.p` and `*.pawn` files, not just only `*.pwn` files
- And maybe more!
